<!-- Theme Toggle Button -->
<button class="theme-toggle" id="themeToggle" aria-label="Toggle theme">
    <svg class="sun-icon" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round">
        <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"></circle>

    </svg>
    <svg class="moon-icon" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round">
        <path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1 1 11.21 3 7 7 0 0 0 21 12.79z"></path>
    </svg>
</button>
```

#### 3. script.js
**Changes made:**
- Added theme toggle DOM element reference
- Implemented theme initialization and toggle functionality
- Added keyboard navigation support (Enter and Space keys)
- Included localStorage for theme persistence
- Added accessibility features with dynamic ARIA labels

**Functions added:**
- `initializeTheme()`: Loads saved theme preference or defaults to dark
- `toggleTheme()`: Switches between light and dark themes
- `setTheme(theme)`: Sets the theme and updates UI accordingly

**Event listeners added:**
- Click handler for theme toggle button
- Keyboard navigation support for accessibility

### Features Implemented

- localStorage support for theme persistence

## Backend Changes - Testing Infrastructure Enhancements

The following backend testing improvements were implemented to support better testing of the RAG system:

### 1. **Enhanced pytest Configuration** (`pyproject.toml`)
- Added comprehensive pytest configuration with proper test discovery
- Added required test dependencies: `httpx` and `pytest-asyncio`
- Configured test markers for `unit`, `integration`, and `api` tests
- Set up clean test output formatting and async test support

### 2. **Shared Test Fixtures** (`tests/conftest.py`)
- Created comprehensive fixture collection for consistent test setup
- Mock configurations for RAG system, vector store, and AI generator
- Sample test data fixtures for courses, queries, and responses
- Test FastAPI app fixture that avoids static file mounting issues
- Automatic warning suppression for cleaner test output

### 3. **Comprehensive API Endpoint Tests** (`tests/test_api_endpoints.py`)
- **Query Endpoint Tests**: Session handling, validation, edge cases
- **Courses Endpoint Tests**: Statistics retrieval and method validation
- **Root Endpoint Tests**: Basic connectivity and method restrictions
- **Error Handling Tests**: Graceful failure handling and validation
- **CORS Tests**: Cross-origin request support verification
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflows and session continuity
- **Response Validation**: Schema compliance and data type verification

### 4. **Test Organization and Execution**
- Tests are now organized with clear markers (`@pytest.mark.api`)
- Supports selective test execution (e.g., `pytest -m api`)
- Enhanced test discovery and clean output formatting
- Proper async test support for FastAPI endpoints

### Test Coverage Summary

- **Total Tests**: 37 tests across all modules
- **API Tests**: 23 comprehensive API endpoint tests
- **Unit Tests**: 14 existing AI generator component tests
- **Test Execution**: All tests pass successfully

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run --python 3.11 pytest tests/ -v

# Run only API tests
uv run --python 3.11 pytest tests/ -m api -v

# Run specific test file
uv run --python 3.11 pytest tests/test_api_endpoints.py -v
```

### Impact on Frontend

While the testing enhancement focused on backend infrastructure, it provides:

1. **API Reliability**: Ensures all frontend API calls will work correctly
2. **Contract Validation**: Verifies request/response schemas match frontend expectations
3. **Error Handling**: Confirms proper error responses for frontend error handling
4. **Session Management**: Validates session continuity for frontend user experience

This testing infrastructure ensures the backend API remains stable and reliable for any future frontend development or changes.
